# Github Pull Requests' statuses

## What is this browsers' extension doing?

This extension intends to enhance the Github pull requests' page, by:

- Adding colors to the following status
  - Draft
  - Requesting changes
  - Review required
  - Approved pull requests
  - (some may be added in the future)
- Adding colors to the obsolete pull requests (default is 15 days old)

It has a settings page which allows to customize the default colors.

## What will Shiny Sporks do in the future?

Better support for Firefox (storage features may have introduced bugs).

Still working on:

- Custom colors by pull request names (RELEASE, BUGFIX etc.)
- Allowing custom selectors (probably mostly in pull requests' name)
- Add weight to status
